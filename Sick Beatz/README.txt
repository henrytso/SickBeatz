Sick Beatz
Music for the next generation


Backend:

No screenshots, our frontend is extremely lacking.
However, attached are Hye Won Kim’s amazing design sketches.


Our vision when making Sick Beatz was to create a valuable social experience around music and build communities with creators and their fans. The music industry today is unsympathetic toward smaller artists. For the majority of modest creators, getting music out into the world is incredibly difficult. A single article publication costs hundreds, if not thousands, on any well-known music blog! We wanted to create an app to support such artists by connecting them with their fan-base as well as their fans with each other (in our Social view). Similarly to how viewers support video-game streamers on Twitch with small donations in the form of subscriptions and bits, we wanted to encourage users to support artists with small donations as they “like” and listen to their favorite artists.


Intended basic layout:
Tabs: Home, MyMusic, Social, Discover
Home: Shows new releases from liked artists, some music from new artists, and ads
MyMusic: Playlist-building and music-streaming functionality
Social: Facebook-style interface, posting for sharing music and discussions
Discover: Explore new music


In an artistVC, there are details about the artist as well as a heart button to “show love” (aka donate haha microtransactions).




A message to the grader:


Deep apologies from the iOS team: we have a heavily lacking frontend that is unacceptable. We had not focused on the right things at the right times and bit off more than we could chew to say the least.


Special apologies to Hye Won, if you are reading this, for not being able to implement your designs, which were really sick.


Special message for AppDev: We love your courses, thank you guys for everything!


We hope that this is not the end of Sick Beatz.
